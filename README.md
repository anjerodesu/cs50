Hello, world! This is a collection of all of my problem sets, hacker sets, and lecture solutions for Harvard University's CS50 [edX.org](https://edx.org) course season 2016. Have fun!

*Note: This repo is to make the history of my work for this course available to me and anyone else who's interested.*

All problem sets are made by me and class lectures are made by their respective owner(s).
